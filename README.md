# Movie Recommendation System


An intelligent content-based movie recommendation system using Count Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity to suggest movies based on genres, cast, directors, and other movie features.


# Project Overview


This project implements a sophisticated movie recommendation engine that analyzes movie metadata to find similar films.

By combining natural language processing with similarity metrics, the system provides personalized movie suggestions based on content features rather than user ratings.
